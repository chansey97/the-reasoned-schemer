of minikanren by Dan Friedman.

This package additionally includes Scribble documentation.

For practical uses, take a look at [cKanren](https://github.com/calvis/cKanren) instead.
It extends miniKanren with better Racket integration and support for constraint programming.

Also see the canonical [minikanren](https://github.com/miniKanren/Racket-miniKanren) repository.
